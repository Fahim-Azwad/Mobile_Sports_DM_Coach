# üîß Quick Fix: Coaches Loading from ScriptableObjects Instead of API

## üö® **Problem Identified:**
You're seeing "Dhruv" and "Adity" coaches because the system is loading from ScriptableObject files in the CoachData folder instead of from the API.

## ‚úÖ **Solution (2 minutes):**

### Step 1: Check CoachManager Settings
1. **Open Unity** and load your FMGCOACH scene
2. **Find CoachManager** in the Hierarchy (should be on a GameObject)
3. **In Inspector**, look for the CoachManager component
4. **Find the checkbox "Load From API"** - it's probably **UNCHECKED**
5. **CHECK the "Load From API" box** ‚úÖ
6. **Verify the Base URL** is set to: `http://localhost:5175`

### Step 2: Test the Fix
1. **Play the scene**
2. **Check the Console** - you should see logs like:
   ```
   [CoachManager] Initializing system. loadFromAPI = True
   [CoachManager] API connection successful
   [CoachManager] Pre-loaded defense coach: Bill Belichick
   [CoachManager] Pre-loaded offense coach: Andy Reid
   ```
3. **Check the UI** - you should now see coaches like Bill Belichick instead of Dhruv/Adity

### Step 3: Debug if Still Not Working
1. **Attach CoachDebugHelper script** to any GameObject
2. **Play scene** and **press C** to check status
3. **Press L** to check API settings
4. **Look for error messages** in console

## üîç **Why This Happened:**
- The `loadFromAPI` flag was set to `false` (default)
- This caused the system to load ScriptableObject coaches (Dhruv, Adity) instead of API coaches
- The modified code now skips ScriptableObject loading when `loadFromAPI = true`

## üéØ **Expected Result After Fix:**
- **Defense Coach**: Bill Belichick, Joe Collier, Buster Ramsey, etc. (from API)
- **Offense Coach**: Joe Bach, Gus Dorais, John Michelosen, etc. (from API)
- **No more**: Dhruv, Adity, or other ScriptableObject coaches

## üöÄ **If API is Down:**
The system will automatically fall back to JSON file at:
`Assets/StreamingAssets/Database/coach.json`

**The fix is simple: Just check the "Load From API" checkbox in CoachManager! ‚úÖ**
