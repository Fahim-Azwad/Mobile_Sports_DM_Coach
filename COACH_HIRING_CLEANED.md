# CoachHiringMarket.cs - Cleaned Up (Toggle Buttons Removed)

## ✅ **Reverted to Clean Implementation**

The CoachHiringMarket.cs script has been cleaned up and reverted to its previous implementation without the toggle button functionality, as requested.

## **What Was Removed:**

### **❌ Removed UI References:**
- `allFilterButton` - Button for "ALL" coaches filter
- `defenseFilterButton` - Button for "D" (Defense) coaches filter  
- `offenseFilterButton` - Button for "O" (Offense) coaches filter
- `specialTeamsFilterButton` - Button for "S" (Special Teams) coaches filter
- `allButtonText` - TextMeshProUGUI for ALL button label
- `defenseButtonText` - TextMeshProUGUI for D button label
- `offenseButtonText` - TextMeshProUGUI for O button label
- `specialTeamsButtonText` - TextMeshProUGUI for S button label

### **❌ Removed Methods:**
- `SetupFilterButtons()` - Button initialization
- `SetFilter(string filterType)` - Programmatic filter setting
- `UpdateButtonStates()` - Visual button state management  
- `SetButtonState(Button button, bool isActive)` - Button color management

### **❌ Removed Setup Calls:**
- Removed `SetupFilterButtons()` call from Start() method
- Removed button state syncing from `OnFilterChanged()`

## **What Remains (Clean Core Functionality):**

### **✅ Dropdown Filter System:**
- **Filter Dropdown**: Full dropdown with "All", "Defense", "Offense", "Special Teams"
- **OnFilterChanged()**: Handles dropdown selection changes
- **Keyboard Controls**: N=New Coaches, T=Toggle Filter, F=Filter Cycle

### **✅ Database Integration:**
- **Dynamic Loading**: Loads coaches from `StreamingAssets/Database/coach.json`
- **Filter Types**: ALL, D, O, S coach filtering
- **Random Selection**: Picks 2 random coaches based on current filter

### **✅ UI Display:**
- **Coach Slot 1 & 2**: Name, salary, rating, type display
- **Top 3 Specialties**: Dynamic specialty calculation and display
- **Budget Display**: Static budget of $500,000

### **✅ Testing Controls:**
- **N Key**: Load new coaches
- **T Key**: Refresh coaches (toggle)
- **F Key**: Cycle through filter types (ALL → D → O → S → ALL)

## **Current Filter System:**

### **Dropdown Options:**
1. **All** (ALL) - Shows all coaches
2. **Defense** (D) - Defense coaches only
3. **Offense** (O) - Offense coaches only  
4. **Special Teams** (S) - Special Teams coaches only

### **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- **N**: Load new random coaches with current filter
- **T**: Refresh/toggle (reload coaches)
- **F**: Cycle through filter types

## **Script Status:**
- ✅ **No compilation errors**
- ✅ **Clean code structure**
- ✅ **All original functionality preserved**
- ✅ **Ready for future toggle button implementation**

## **For Future Toggle Button Implementation:**
The script structure is now clean and ready. When you want to add toggle buttons later, you can:
1. Add button references to the script inspector
2. Add the button setup methods back
3. Connect button clicks to filter changes

The core filtering logic remains intact and will work seamlessly with any future UI additions.
