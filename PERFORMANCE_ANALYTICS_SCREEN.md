```

## üîß **System Setup**

### **Required Components**
Ensure these elements exist in your scene:

```
Hierarchy:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StatCardPopulator (with StatCardPopulator script)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BeforeContainer (Transform for before-coaching stats)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AfterContainer (Transform for after-coaching stats)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WeeklyBreakdownContainer (Transform for timeline data)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StatRowPrefab (Prefab for individual stat rows)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SummaryTextComponents (TMP_Text for analysis summary)
```

### **Auto-Setup with SystemSetupHelper**
```csharp
// Add to any GameObject for automatic setup
[ContextMenu("Setup Performance Analytics")]
public void SetupPerformanceAnalytics()
{
    // Creates all required containers and components
}
```

## üìà **Data Integration**

### **Performance Data Sources**

#### **API Backend Integration**
```csharp
// Load performance data from server
GET /api/performance/{teamId}
GET /api/performance/matches/{teamId}

// Calculate coaching impact
POST /api/performance/calculate
{
    "teamId": "team_123",
    "beforePeriod": "weeks_1_10", 
    "afterPeriod": "weeks_11_20"
}
```

#### **Local JSON Fallback**
```json
// Assets/StreamingAssets/Database/performance.json
{
    "teamId": "default_team",
    "beforeCoaching": {
        "wins": 4,
        "losses": 6,
        "pointsScored": 18.5,
        "pointsAllowed": 22.3
    },
    "afterCoaching": {
        "wins": 8,
        "losses": 2, 
        "pointsScored": 24.7,
        "pointsAllowed": 16.8
    }
}
```

### **Stat Categories**

#### **Offensive Metrics**
- **Points Per Game**: Average scoring output
- **Total Yards**: Offensive yardage production
- **Passing Efficiency**: Quarterback rating and completion %
- **Rushing Average**: Yards per carry and attempts
- **Red Zone Conversion**: Scoring percentage in red zone
- **Third Down Conversion**: Success rate on 3rd downs

#### **Defensive Metrics**  
- **Points Allowed**: Average points given up per game
- **Total Defense**: Yards allowed per game
- **Sacks**: Quarterback sacks per game

## üéØ **Coaching Impact Analysis**

### **ROI Calculation**
The system calculates Return on Investment for coaching expenses:

```csharp
// ROI Formula
float coachingCost = (defenseCoach.weeklySalary + offenseCoach.weeklySalary) * 10; // 10 weeks
float performanceGain = (afterWinRate - beforeWinRate) * 100f;
float roi = (performanceGain / coachingCost) * 1000000f; // ROI per million spent

// Example: 15% win rate improvement, $500K coaching cost = 30.0 ROI
```

### **Performance Metrics**
```csharp
public class PerformanceMetrics
{
    public float winRateImprovement;    // Percentage point change
    public float offensiveImprovement;  // Points per game increase
    public float defensiveImprovement;  // Points allowed decrease
    public float specialTeamsImpact;    // Overall ST efficiency change
    public float overallTeamRating;     // Combined performance score
}
```

## üé® **UI Components**

### **Stat Row Display**
Each statistic is displayed with:
```csharp
// StatRow Components
- Icon: Sport-specific imagery (football, trophy, etc.)
- Label: Stat category name
- Before Value: Performance before coaching
- After Value: Performance after coaching  
- Arrow: Visual improvement/decline indicator
- Percentage: Quantified change amount
```

### **Visual Settings**
```csharp
[Header("Visual Settings")]
public Vector2 iconSize = new Vector2(20, 20);
public Vector2 arrowSize = new Vector2(20, 20);
public float labelFontSize = 16f;
public float valueFontSize = 16f;
public Color improvementColor = Color.green;
public Color declineColor = Color.red;
```

### **Weekly Timeline**
```csharp
// Weekly breakdown display
Week 1-10: Building foundation, establishing systems
Week 11-15: Implementing coaching changes
Week 16-20: Seeing results, performance improvements
```

## üí∞ **Investment Analysis**

### **Cost-Benefit Summary**
```csharp
public class InvestmentSummary
{
    public float totalCoachingInvestment;  // Total spent on coaches
    public float weeklyCoachingCost;       // Ongoing weekly expenses
    public float performanceROI;           // Return on investment percentage
    public string investmentRecommendation; // Continue/Adjust/Replace recommendation
}
```

### **Budget Impact Display**
- **Total Investment**: Sum of all coaching salaries and hiring costs
- **Weekly Expense**: Ongoing operational costs
- **Performance Gain**: Measurable improvement metrics

## üîÑ **Automatic Data Updates**

### **Real-time Integration**
```csharp
// Auto-refresh when coaches change
private void OnEnable()
{
    CoachManager.OnCoachHired += RefreshPerformanceData;
    CoachManager.OnCoachFired += RefreshPerformanceData;
}

// Update performance when new match data available
public void RefreshPerformanceData()
{
    StartCoroutine(LoadPerformanceDataFromAPI());
}
```

### **Data Refresh Triggers**
- **Coach Hiring**: New performance projections
- **Coach Firing**: Impact assessment of coaching changes

## üß™ **Testing & Validation**

### **Demo Mode**
```csharp
// PerformanceAnalyticsDemo script for testing
[ContextMenu("Generate Demo Data")]
public void GenerateDemoData()
{
    // Creates realistic before/after scenarios
    // Useful for testing UI layout and calculations
}
```

### **Debug Features**
```csharp
[Header("Debug Settings")]
[SerializeField] private bool showDebugCalculations = true;
[SerializeField] private bool logPerformanceData = true;
[SerializeField] private bool simulateAPIFailure = false;
```

### **Validation Checks**
- **Data Consistency**: Verify before/after periods don't overlap
- **Calculation Accuracy**: Validate ROI and percentage calculations
- **UI Responsiveness**: Ensure smooth updates during data changes

## üì± **Mobile Optimization**

### **Responsive Design**
- **Adaptive Layouts**: Adjusts to different screen sizes
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large tap targets for interaction
- **Scrollable Content**: Handles extensive statistics lists

### **Performance Optimization**
```csharp
// Efficient data loading
private void LoadPerformanceDataAsync()
{
    // Background loading prevents UI freezing
    // Incremental updates for smooth user experience
}
```

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **No Performance Data Displayed**
```
Causes:
- StatCardPopulator not found in scene
- Missing data containers (BeforeContainer, AfterContainer)
- API server not providing performance data

Solutions:
1. Add StatCardPopulator script to GameObject
2. Assign container references in Inspector
3. Check backend server endpoints
4. Verify JSON fallback data exists
```

#### **Incorrect Calculations**
```
Causes:
- Coach salary data missing
- Performance period misconfiguration
- Division by zero in ROI calculations

Solutions:
1. Verify coach data integrity
2. Check before/after period definitions
3. Add safety checks for zero values
```

#### **UI Layout Issues**
```
Causes:
- Missing prefab references
- Incorrect container hierarchy
- Font or asset loading failures

Solutions:
1. Reassign StatRowPrefab in Inspector
2. Verify container parent-child relationships
3. Check TextMeshPro package installation
```

    public string recommendation;       // Coaching strategy suggestions
}
```

### **Coaching Efficiency Metrics**
```csharp
// Measure coaching effectiveness
public class CoachingEfficiency
{
    public float impactPerDollar;      // Performance gain per salary dollar
    public float timeToImprovement;    // Weeks to see coaching results
