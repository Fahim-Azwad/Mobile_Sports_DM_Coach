## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **Data Flow**
```
Database JSON Files → PerformanceDashboardAPI → UI Components
                   ↓
1. Extract: Get team data and hired coaches
2. Load: Calculate performance metrics  
3. Transform: Convert to UI format
4. Display: Populate StatCardPopulator UI
```

### **Performance Calculations**
```csharp
// Rating Calculation (0-90 scale)
offenseRating = (passing + rush + redZone) / 3 * 15
defenseRating = (runDefense + pressure + coverage) / 3 * 15
specialTeamsRating = (fieldGoals + kickoffs + returns) / 3 * 15

// Win Rate Calculation
winRate = 40% + ((averageRating - baseline) * 1.2%)

// Performance Gain
performanceGain = sum(coachRating - 3) * 2.5% per coach
```

### **Integration Points**
- **HiringMarketAPI**: Team budget data
- **FMGCoachingStaffAPI**: Hired coaches database
- **CoachDatabaseRecord**: Individual coach statistics
- **Unity UI System**: TextMeshPro and Layout components
