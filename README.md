### **Database Schema (coach.json)**
```json
{
  "coach_id": "unique_id",
  "coach_name": "Coach Name",
  "coach_type": "D|O|S",     // Defense/Offense/Special Teams
  "experience": 5,
  "salary": 2.5,             // In millions (converted to weekly)
  "overall_rating": 4.2,     // 1-5 scale
  
  // Detailed Stats (0-10 scale)
  "run_defence": 8.5,
  "pressure_control": 7.2,
  "coverage_discipline": 9.1,
  "turnover": 6.8,
  
  "passing_efficiency": 7.5,
  "rush": 8.2,
  "red_zone_conversion": 9.0,
  "play_variation": 6.5,
  
  "field_goal_accuracy": 8.8,
  "kickoff_instance": 7.3,
  "return_speed": 8.1,
  "return_coverage": 7.9
}
```

### **Coach Types**
- **Defense (D)**: Run Defense, Pressure Control, Coverage Discipline, Turnover Generation
- **Offense (O)**: Passing Efficiency, Rushing Attack, Red Zone Conversion, Play Variation
- **Special Teams (S)**: Field Goal Accuracy, Kickoff Distance, Return Speed, Return Coverage

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Unity 2022.3 LTS or later
- TextMeshPro package installed

### **Setup Instructions**
1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fahim-Azwad/Mobile_Sports_DM_Coach.git
   ```

2. **Open in Unity**
   - Launch Unity Hub
   - Click "Open" and select the project folder
   - Wait for Unity to import assets

3. **Configure Database**
   - Ensure `Assets/StreamingAssets/Database/coach.json` exists
   - Database is automatically loaded at runtime

4. **Test the System**
   - Open `Assets/Scenes/FMGCOACH.unity`
   - Play the scene
   - Use N/T/F keys to test coach loading

## 🎯 **Key Features Breakdown**

### **CoachData.cs Enhancement**
- **Dual System Support**: Works with both Unity Inspector and JSON database
- **Auto-Conversion**: `CreateFromDatabaseRecord()` bridges database to ScriptableObject
- **Extended Stats**: Added all database fields while maintaining Unity compatibility
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing coach assets continue working unchanged

### **Dynamic Filtering System**
- **Dropdown Filter**: User-friendly selection interface
- **Keyboard Controls**: Development-friendly testing shortcuts
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant coach loading based on filter selection
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Default coaches when filtered results are insufficient

### **UI Enhancements**
- **Specialty Calculation**: Converts 0-10 database stats to 0-50% bonuses
- **Top N Display**: Shows best 3-4 specialties per coach
- **Currency Formatting**: Professional salary display with thousands separators
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing data or files

## 🛠 **Development**

### **Adding New Coaches**
1. **Via JSON Database**: Add entries to `coach.json`
2. **Via Unity Inspector**: Create new CoachData ScriptableObject assets
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Use both systems simultaneously

### **Extending Coach Types**
1. Update `CoachType` enum in `CoachData.cs`
2. Add new stat categories to `CoachDatabaseRecord`
3. Update specialty calculation logic in UI scripts
