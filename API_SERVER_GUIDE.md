# API Server Integration Guide

## Issue Summary
The Unity application is trying to connect to Ruturaj's backend API server at `http://localhost:5175`, but the server is not running, causing "Cannot connect to destination host" errors.

## Solution Implemented
‚úÖ **Fallback System Added**: The CoachHiringMarket script now gracefully handles API unavailability:

- **API Available**: Uses dynamic data from Ruturaj's backend
- **API Unavailable**: Falls back to local coach database with proper filtering

## How to Fix the API Connection

### Option 1: Start Ruturaj's Backend Server
1. Navigate to Ruturaj's backend project directory
2. Run the backend server (typically with `dotnet run` or similar)
3. Ensure it's running on `http://localhost:5175`
4. Restart Unity - you should see: `‚úÖ API server is available - using dynamic API data`

### Option 2: Use Local Data (Current Setup)
The application now works perfectly without the API:
- Shows local coaches from the CoachManager database
- Uses fallback budget of $50,000,000
- All filtering and hiring features work
- You'll see: `‚ö†Ô∏è API server not available - using local fallback data`

## What Was Fixed
1. **API Connection Testing**: Added automatic API availability check on startup
2. **Local Coach Loading**: Falls back to CoachManager's local database when API is down
3. **Coach Filtering**: Local coaches are filtered by type (Defense, Offense, etc.) to match API behavior
4. **Budget Fallback**: Uses default budget when team budget API is unavailable
5. **Error Handling**: No more repeated connection errors - graceful fallback instead

## Log Messages to Look For
- `üß™ Starting System Tests...` - System tester running
- `‚úÖ API server is available` - API working, using dynamic data
- `‚ö†Ô∏è API server not available` - Using local fallback (normal if backend not running)
- `Loaded X coaches from local database` - Local coaches loaded successfully

## Current Status
‚úÖ **API Integration Complete**: Full dynamic loading when backend is available
‚úÖ **Fallback System Working**: Local data used when backend is unavailable  
‚úÖ **No Compilation Errors**: All scripts compile cleanly
‚úÖ **Robust Error Handling**: No more connection spam in logs

The coach hiring market now works in both scenarios - with or without the backend API server.
