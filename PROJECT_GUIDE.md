# 🏈 Mobile Sports DM Coach - Complete Project Guide

*Unity-based mobile sports management game with advanced coaching system integration*

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

This project implements a comprehensive coaching management system with:
- **Advanced Coach Database**: Dynamic loading from JSON with ScriptableObject fallback
- **Performance Analytics**: Real-time coaching impact tracking and ROI analysis  
- **Save/Load System**: Persistent game state with delta tracking between sessions
- **Runtime Validation**: JSON/ScriptableObject bridge with performance monitoring

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

### **1. Testing Your Setup**
Add the `SystemTester.cs` script to any GameObject to verify all systems:
```csharp
// Automatic testing on game start
[SerializeField] private bool runTestsOnStart = true;
```

**Manual Test Controls:**
- **N Key**: Load new coaches from database
- **T Key**: Toggle filter refresh
- **F Key**: Cycle filters (All → Defense → Offense → Special Teams)

### **2. Essential Scripts Setup**

**Core Systems (Auto-initialized as singletons):**
- `SaveLoadLogic` - Handles all save/load operations
- `RuntimeValidator` - Validates data integrity and performance
- `StatusDeltaChecker` - Tracks stat changes between games

**UI Systems:**
- `CoachHiringMarket` - Coach selection and hiring interface
- `CoachProfilePopulator` - Detailed coach information display
- `StatCardPopulator` - Performance dashboard with analytics

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **SaveLoadLogic Settings**
```csharp
[SerializeField] private bool enableBackups = true;
[SerializeField] private int maxBackupFiles = 5;
[SerializeField] private float autoSaveInterval = 60f; // seconds
```

### **RuntimeValidator Settings**
```csharp
[SerializeField] private bool enableRuntimeValidation = true;
[SerializeField] private float validationInterval = 5f; // seconds
[SerializeField] private float saveTimeWarningThreshold = 100f; // ms
```

### **StatusDeltaChecker Settings**
```csharp
[SerializeField] private bool enableDeltaTracking = true;
[SerializeField] private float deltaCheckInterval = 1f; // seconds
[SerializeField] private int maxDeltaHistory = 200;
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing Your Implementation**

### **Automated Testing**
```csharp
// SystemTester runs comprehensive checks:
1. Script instances validation
2. SaveLoadLogic functionality
3. RuntimeValidator operations
4. StatusDeltaChecker tracking
5. System integration tests
```

### **Manual Testing Checklist**
```
□ Load game → Hire a coach → Check if data persists after restart
□ Performance dashboard shows coach impact metrics
□ Delta tracking records stat changes over time
□ Runtime validator catches data inconsistencies
□ Save/load operations complete without errors
```

### **Debug Logs to Monitor**
```csharp
"[SaveLoadLogic] Coach data saved successfully"
"[RuntimeValidator] Validation completed - All systems operational"
"[StatusDeltaChecker] Significant delta detected"
"[SystemTester] 🎉 All systems are working correctly!"
```

## 🎯 **Success Indicators**

**✅ Working System Signs:**
- Coach hiring persists between game sessions
- Performance dashboard shows meaningful analytics
- Console shows validation success messages
- No null reference or JSON parsing errors
- Delta tracking shows coach impact over time

**❌ Common Issues:**
- Missing singleton instances (check GameObject placement)
- JSON parsing errors (validate database files)
- Save path not accessible (check permissions)
- Performance warnings (optimize validation intervals)

---

## 📞 **Support**

**Quick Fixes:**
1. **Scripts not working**: Run SystemTester to identify issues
2. **Data not saving**: Check Application.persistentDataPath access
3. **Performance issues**: Adjust validation intervals in inspector
4. **Coach data missing**: Verify StreamingAssets/Database/coach.json exists

*For detailed implementation logs, check Unity Console with "RuntimeValidator", "SaveLoadLogic", or "StatusDeltaChecker" filters.*
